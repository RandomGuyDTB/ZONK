# ZONK
ZONK for the TI-83+.

See the releases page for the release, complete with the 8XP file for direct transfer to your calculator. Alternatively, you can download the code, edit out the comments, use [TokensIDE](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/433/43315.html "ticalc.org") to build the program into an IDE, and then use [TI-Connect](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw "ti.com") to transfer that to a real calculator.
